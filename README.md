# <a href="http://weebly-junior.herokuapp.com">WEEBLY TRIAL PROJECT</a>#
========================

<b>Welcome to my source code! </b>

This project is made with <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/tutorial/">Flask</a> and MongoDB. It is hosted on Heroku and includes a few logging and notification plugins as well. The dependencies listed in README.md include all pip dependencies installed on my computer (generated with pip freeze > requirements.txt) and not all are used in this project.

The content is stored in a nested array in the pages collection, and users are stored in the sessions collection. I've only stored the access_token (from google or fb), the user_id, and the generated weebly_token, which is a random selection of characters from the user's access_token.

<b>TO TEST LOCALLY: </b><br>
source venv/bin/activate <br>
pip install -r requirements.txt <br>
foreman start web <br>

Api token for testing: <b>IJ6MXxAmiq </b> <br>
You only need a token if you are not logged in.<br>
Sample page ID for testing: <b>544a0774882819000754b501 </b><br>

# BUGS AND TODO #
