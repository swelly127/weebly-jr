========================
# WEEBLY TRIAL PROJECT #
========================

Most of the code here is copied from another website I made using <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/tutorial/">Flask</a> and MongoDB. It is hosted with Heroku and includes a few logging and notification plugins as well.

Explain users and pages table.

TO TEST:
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt 
foreman start web

Site will be viewable at 127.0.0.1:5000
